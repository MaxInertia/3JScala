# 3JScala [[Try me!](https://maxinertia.github.io/3JScala/)] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MaxInertia/3JScala.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/MaxInertia/3JScala)

A 3D/VR Data Visualization tool using Three.js, written in Scala!

The only VR device available during development of this project so far has been the Oculus Rift (albeit with limited access). Support for different devices would be ideal, however without access to them I have no way of testing with them!

Anyone have a spare?! ðŸ˜†
